- Clean the entire dataset.
- Test the CNN in the cnn.ipynb notebook.
- Try to port it over to running on GPU using Google Collab or purchase a small VM with a GPU.
- Add optimizations to make the model faster.
- Check if the model is overfitting, if it is, implement dropout.
- Try using different images and see if this changes anything.
- Consider other optimizations to the simple CNN before moving to transformers. Perhaps add another layer, try reducing/increasing dimensionality, try asking for more data, etc..
- Then move onto transformers.
